								In a large installation in a location with hundreds of networks enabled digital signage screen. When every screen uses his individual internet connection to fetch updates, you will get a bottleneck. With a reverse proxy, you can share one internet connection and increase security, as the player do not need direct access to the internet to receive content.

								 The principle is relatively simple. The media players do not connect to the digital signage CMS on the Internet as usual, but instead to the proxy server on the intranet. The Garlic proxy connects to the CMS on a time-controlled basis and retrieves the necessary content. Once downloaded, the intranet players update themselves based on what the proxy prepares for them.
