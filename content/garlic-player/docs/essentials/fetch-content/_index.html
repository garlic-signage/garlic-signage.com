					<h2 id="refresh_request">How Refresh Request is sent</h2>
					<p>
						Digital signage media player in a network regularly points to an http-address which has the index. To do this as efficiently as possible, there are two types of requests:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>HEAD-Requests</li>
						<li>GET-Requests</li>
					</ul>
					On each refresh cycle, the player sends HEAD request first.
					<article>
						<h3 id="head-requests">The HEAD-Request</h3>
						<p>
							The HEAD request only asks for the HTTP header with an empty body to save bandwidth and server resources. The server should send an HTTP "Etag," “Last-Modified:” and a “Content-Length:” in his header. Due to this information, the player can decide to send a GET-Request to get a new SMIL index or not.
						</p>
						<p>
							Garlic player will send the following HEAD-Request if he asks for a file he did not fetch before.
						</p>
<pre><code class="language-http line-numbers">HEAD /index.smil HTTP/1.1
	Host: content-url.com
</code></pre>						<p>
							If the file is already fetched, garlic-player will add If-None-Match and If-Modified-Since as fallback.
						</p>
<pre><code class="language-http line-numbers">HEAD /index.smil HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com
   If-None-Match: "a1b2c3d4e5f6"
   If-Modified-Since: Wed, 15 Nov 2023 12:30:45 GMT
</code></pre>
					</article>
					<article>
						<h3 id="server-response">Reaction on Server Response</h3>
						<p>
							When the server sends back a 304 Not modified response after HEAD request, garlic player will not send a GET request. This will happen only on a 200 OK.
						</p>
						<p>
							In this way we ensure the client/server communication is as efficient as possible.
						</p>
						<p>
							Have in mind that the priority is to check etag (If-None-Match), as If-Modified-Since is not accurate enough.
