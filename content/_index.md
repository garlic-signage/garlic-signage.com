GarlicSignage is an open-source software suite for digital signage, built on the industry-standard SMIL language. Our mission is to provide clear tools and documentation to help you create effective and adaptable signage solutions.

- **Garlic Player:** lightweight media player, fully SMIL 3.0 compatible.
- **Garlic Hub:** content and device management with SMIL playlists and scheduling.

Whether you're a developer looking for a reliable framework or a user ready to build stunning digital signage playlists, you'll find everything you need here:

- **For Users:** create playlists and run them on any compatible device.
- **For Developers:** extend, adapt, and contribute via GitHub.
