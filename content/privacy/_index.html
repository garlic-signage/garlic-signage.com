						<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
						<p>
							Our website may be used without entering personal information. Different rules may apply to certain services on our site, however, and are explained separately below. We collect personal information from you (e.g. name, address, email address, telephone number, etc.) in accordance with the provisions of German data protection statutes. Information is considered personal if it can be associated exclusively to a specific natural person. The legal framework for data protection may be found in the German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) and the Telemedia Act (TMG). The provisions below serve to provide information as to the manner, extent and purpose for collecting, using and processing personal information by the provider.
							Please be aware that data transfer via the internet is subject to security risks and, therefore, complete protection against third-party access to transferred data cannot be ensured.

						<h3>Server Data</h3>
						<p>
							For technical reasons, data such as the following, which your internet browser transmits to us or to our webspace provider (so-called server log files), is collected: — type and version of the browser you use — operating system — websites that linked you to our site (referrer URL) — websites that you visit — date and time of your visit — your Internet Protocol (IP) address. This anonymous data is stored separately from any personal information you may have provided, thereby making it impossible to connect it to any particular person. The data is used for statistical purposes in order to improve our website and services. Log file information is stored for a maximum of 30 days for security reasons (e.g., to investigate misuse or fraud) and then deleted. Data whose further storage is required for evidential purposes are excluded from deletion until the respective incident has been finally clarified.
