			<h2>Why do you need the Garlic-Launcher?</h2>
			<p>
				Running screens or interactive kiosk systems 24/7 comes with key challenges.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Security: You do not want someone to hack your device</li>
				<li>Monitoring device health, heartbeat, and more </li>
				<li>Remote administration (update, reboot, maintenance)</li>
				<li>Manual configuration as easy as possible</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The “garlic” approach is to separate the software for industrial media player hardware in two parts.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li><a href="/garlic-player/">Garlic-player</a> as platform independent media player</li>
				<li>garlic-launcher as a small native interface to the Android management functions</li>
