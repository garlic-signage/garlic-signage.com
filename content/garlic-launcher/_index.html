					If you want to run a screen or interactive kiosk system 24/7, you need to think about some challenges.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Security: You do not want someone to hack your device</li>
					<li>Monitoring device health, heartbeat, and more </li>
					<li>Remote administration (update, reboot, maintenance)</li>
					<li>Manual configuration as easy as possible</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The “garlic” approach is to separate the software for industrial media player hardware in two parts.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li><a href="/garlic-player/">Garlic-player</a> as platform independent media player</li>
					<li>garlic-launcher as a small native interface to the Android management functions</li>
				</ol>
